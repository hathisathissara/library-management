## üèõÔ∏è About The Project

The goal of Librarian Pro is to digitize and simplify the core operations of a library. This system replaces manual record-keeping with an efficient, web-based solution. It's built on a classic server-side stack (PHP/MySQL), making it reliable and easy to deploy. The project is designed with two primary user roles in mind: the **Librarian (Admin)** who manages the system, and the **Member (User)** who interacts with the library's collection.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a local copy of the system up and running.

### Prerequisites

You will need a local web server environment that supports PHP and MySQL.
*   **XAMPP** is a recommended free and open-source cross-platform web server solution. [Download XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html).

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    Clone this project into your local server's main web directory.
    *   For **XAMPP**, this is typically the `htdocs` folder (`C:\xampp\htdocs`).
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/hathisathissara/library-management/new/main?filename=README.md C:/xampp/htdocs/library-system
    ```

2.  **Start Apache & MySQL:**
    Open the XAMPP Control Panel and start the **Apache** and **MySQL** services.

3.  **Create the Database:**
    a. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost/phpmyadmin/`.
    b. Create a new database and name it `lms_db` (or a name of your choice).
    c. Select the newly created database and click on the **Import** tab.
    d. Click "Choose File" and select the `.sql` file provided in this project (e.g., `database/lms_db.sql`).
    e. Click "Go" to import the database structure and sample data.

4.  **Configure the Database Connection:**

    b. Open the file and edit the credentials to match your local setup.
    ```php
    <?php
    define('DB_SERVER', 'localhost');
    define('DB_USERNAME', 'root');      // Default XAMPP username
    define('DB_PASSWORD', '');          // Default XAMPP password is empty
    define('DB_NAME', 'lms_db');        // The name of the database you created
    ?>
    ```

5.  **Run the Application:**
    You're all set! Open your browser and go to `http://localhost/library-system`.
